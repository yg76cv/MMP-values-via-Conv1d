This is the code for "A Lightweight 1D Deep Convolutional Neural Network for MMP Prediction in CO2-EOR Process" The codes will be included after final acceptance for publishing the related scientific paper.

If you want to test our experiment, you should run train.py and reserve the weights of your training model, and then utilize them for test.py.

The test data can be divdied with the train.py. The output files can be obtain with running test.py.
