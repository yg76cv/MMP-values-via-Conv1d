This is the code for "A Lightweight 1D Deep Convolutional Neural Network for MMP Prediction in CO2-EOR Process" The codes will be included after final acceptance for publishing the related scientific paper.

The complete source code are provided in main.py.
If you want to test our experiment, you should run testdemo.py. The test data are listed in code. The e1.pth and e2.pth are provided weights of our model, which are utilized for testing.

we have provided the data in MMP.csv and the real values of MMP are provided in Realvalue.csv.
